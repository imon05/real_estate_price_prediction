# real_estate_price_prediction
This project aims to predict Bengaluru real estate prices based on features like location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms (BHK). Using a dataset containing property listings, I developed a machine learning model that accurately estimates the price of a house given relevant input features.
